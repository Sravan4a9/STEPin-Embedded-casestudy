# Introduction
The main feature of this project is to provide warmness to the user who uses it .It can detect whether the person is sitting in the car or not.This is one of the main functionality that exits in this system.

In our project the heat is only provided when the person is sitting in the car otherwise it will not work.

And the person sitting in the car can adjust the temperature according to their will.

# FEATURES
1.FMVSS 302 flammability compliant

2.9” x 19” heating elements included

3.Three element trimming locations

4.Insulation protects wires from damage

5.Latching wire harness connectors

6.High-temp rated element adhesive

# SWOT Analysis- Strengths, Weakness Opportunities and Threats

## Strengths
1.Low cost

2.Modular Based Programs

4.User Friendly

## Weakness
1.It's only applicable for the countries which having lowest temperture

## Opportunities
1.It can be implemented in some countries where temperature is very low in winter.

## Threats
1.It is not suitable for higher temperature environments.

# 4W's and 1'H
