The main feature of this project is to provide warmness to the user who uses it .It can detect whether the person is sitting in the car or not.This is one of the main functionality that exits in this system.

In our project the heat is only provided when the person is sitting in the car otherwise it will not work.

And the person sitting in the car can adjust the temperature according to their will.

2.9” x 19” heating elements included

3.Three element trimming locations

4.Insulation protects wires from damage

5.Latching wire harness connectors

6.High-temp rated element adhesive

# SWOT Analysis- Strengths, Weakness Opportunities and Threats

# 4W's and 1'H

## 4W's
## Who:
 * All students in school or college level

## What:
* By using the calculator we can perform the basic calculations easily.

## When:
* The calculator came to usage many years ago .Previously there were other ways to do it.

## Where:
* Schools,colleges and engineering students.

## 1'H
## How:
* The usage of this project is very simple as it is an input output application. The user just needs to type in whatever he or she needs for example, if he or she needs to know the addition of two numbers,then the numbers and the symbol related to operation has to be given as input then output is shown
